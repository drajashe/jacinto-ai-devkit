This repository provides various training **tools for AI**, including Deep Learning, traditional Machine Learning and Computer Vision. This github repository does not contain any code, but has submodule links that point to the code. 

Embedded AI, especially Embedded Inference of Deep Learning models is quite challenging - due to high compute requirements. We show several **low complexity** Deep Learning models that make  Inference on Low Power Embedded Platforms practical. We also have examples for **Quantization Aware Training** for 8-bit fixed point inference.

**Several of these models have been verified to work on [TI's Jacinto Automotive Processors](http://www.ti.com/processors/automotive-processors/tdax-adas-socs/overview.html)**. These tools and software are primarily intended as examples for learning and research.  

### Documentation
Detailed documentation is provided for each of the components. Please browse using links provided in the "Submodules" section below.

### Obtaining the code
After cloning this repository, execute the following command to pull the submodules.
```
./git_submodule_update.sh
```
If there is any issue with the above script, you can visit [https://git.ti.com/jacinto-ai-devkit](https://git.ti.com/jacinto-ai-devkit ) and get the URLs to manually clone/pull the respositories.


### Submodules

Deep Learning Examples for Jacinto7 family of devices - e.g. [TDA4VM](http://www.ti.com/product/TDA4VM)
- [**pytorch-jacinto-ai-devkit**](https://git.ti.com/cgit/jacinto-ai-devkit/pytorch-jacinto-ai-devkit/about/): PyTorch based training of Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Motion Segmentation and various other Pixel2Pixel tasks, Multi-Task Learning and **Quantization Aware Training**.
- PyTorch based **Object Detection** training - **(coming later...)**. In the mean while you can train the SSD Object detector using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and provide the model to Jacinto7 TIDL in a format that it specifies.
- **TensorFlow2.0** based quantization examples - **(coming later...)**.

Deep Learning and Traditional ML examples for Jacinto 6 family of devices - e.g. (TDA2x, TDA3x)
- [**caffe-jacinto**](https://git.ti.com/cgit/jacinto-ai-devkit/caffe-jacinto/about/) and [**caffe-jacinto-models**](https://git.ti.com/cgit/jacinto-ai-devkit/caffe-jacinto-models/about/): Caffe based training tools for sparse CNN models.
- [**acf-jacinto**](https://git.ti.com/cgit/jacinto-ai-devkit/acf-jacinto/about/) - training tool for HOG/ACF/AdaBoost Object Detector (traditional machine learning based)


### Notes: 
- **Each of those submodules have detailed documentation and separate LICENSE files.** Click on the links to open the documentation. 
- If you click on one of the links above - it will navigate to a repository hosted in **https://git.ti.com/jacinto-ai-devkit**. From there, you can click on one of the tabs to get more information on that repository. 
- For example, the **about** tab shows documentation. The **summary** tab lists all the branches, commit information and links for cloning that repository (i.e. if you would like to directly clone without using the above submodule command).


### What is New: 
- [2020-Jan-28] pytorch-jacinto-ai-devkit: Documentation and results for Depth Estimation has been added.<br>
- [2020-Jan-06] pytorch-jacinto-ai-devkit: Quantization documentation is updated. Trained Quantization using QuantTrainModule is now the recommended method of doing Quantization Aware Training and the use of QuantCalibrateModule is discouraged.
